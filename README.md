# 🎄🎁 Advent of Code 2023! 🎁🎄
Currently using my own compiler to complete these challenges. It is based off `holyc` by Terry A. Davis however the assembly I am generating is `x86_64 AT&T` meaning I can run the code on my intel mac. This is effectively going to form the test suite for the compiler! Once it is more robust I will release it. It's currently extremely painful to work with.

`builtins.HC` are some assembly helpers I've written to be able to do repeated things

There might be splatterings of other languages but for most of the years the code is mostly `c`

## Building 🎅🏻
For the less esoteric languages a `c` compiler will suffice

## Previous years
- [2020](/2020/README.md) Mixture of languages
- [2021](/2021/README.md) `c`
- [2022](/2022/README.md) `c`
- [2023](/2022/README.md) my own custom holyc compiler.
